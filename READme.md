***CRYPTOCURRENCY-LIVE-TRADING-BOT***

***What does it do?***

This program utilizes the Coinbase Pro Sandbox API to autonomously execute market trades on any cryptocurrency Coinbase allows. This is ideal for DCA investing and those who find the Coinbase Pro trading view complicated. Currently set up to buy Bitcoin as that as I believe it is the supreme Crypto.

With the GUI you can execute a multitude of functions. With this format it makes the program much more user friendly.

***Tech used***

Python, Pandas, PysSimpleGUI, Requests, JSON and, CoinBase Pro Sandbox API


The functional GUI I created aka the Crypto Command Center
